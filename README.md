# Quran.epub
This is the epub version of the holy quran (in arabic) dedicated for ereader and based on the original texts coming from https://tanzil.net/

## Background
I've struggled finding a good quran ebook for my kobo, here are some of the issues I've addressed on my version:
 - no uthmani writing and signs
 - slow or freezes
 - bad formating and css
 - no good index/navgation
 - no embaded arabic fonts
 - hindi numbers instead of the arabic ones


## The epub and the changes 
All texts are coming stright from tanzil library without any changes
I've split the text into several files to speed up pagination
I replaced the rub' sign with a simple star to enhance performance
I created menus/navigations and all the common requirements for an epub books

## Font
The font embaded to this me_quran
