# Quran.epub
This is the epub version of the holy quran (in arabic) dedicated for ereader and based on the original texts coming from https://tanzil.net/

## Background
I've struggled finding a good quran book that would have uthmani writing style with all the signs and arabic numbers (instead of hindi numbers), an even when I found some it did run so slow on my Kobo Clara and Kobo Libra H2O, and sometimes it even crash. 

## The epub and the changes 
I didn't change any text from the original text coming from tanzil library
I did split the text into Surats
I did split surat into Hizbs when the surat has many Hizbs (eg in Al Baqarah)
I replaced the rub' sign with a star to enhance performance
I compiled the text into an epub format
Created menus and all the standard requirements for epub books

## Tests and issues
I'm only using this on Kobo Clara HD and Kobo Libra H2O, if you try it on any other ereader and find issues, please let me know I will be glad to fix the bugs
